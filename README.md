# Product Recommendation System for E-Commerce

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing product recommendations and understanding market trends for an online retail platform. The goal was to develop a personalized recommendation system to improve user experience and optimize business strategies. Using a SQL-based data warehouse to store and manage customer and sales data, the project analyzed 10,000+ customer records, forecasted sales trends, and applied Python-based models for recommendation.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized in a SQL-based data warehouse with multiple tables for customer data, sales records, product information, and regional market data. The primary data sources for this analysis are:

- **Superstore Data**: Purchase history and revenue data.
- **Superstore Reviews Data**: Ratings, reviews, and summaries provided by customers.

The dataset consists of over 10,000 records with 36 columns, including both features and target variables.

## Executive Summary
This project successfully implemented a SQL-based data warehouse and developed product recommendation models to enhance customer experience and drive sales growth. Key insights included:

- **Most Profitable Segment**: The "Consumer" category showed the highest revenue and profitability.
- **Top Performing Region**: California emerged as the most profitable market.
- **Underperforming Market**: North Dakota was identified as an area for improvement.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predictions indicated growth in Q4 2018, providing opportunities for targeted marketing.

## Key Insights
